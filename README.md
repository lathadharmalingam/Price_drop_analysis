Hello everyone! 
I wanted to analyze the laptop prices, which have dropped from their previous prices.

<a>https://www.pricebefore.com/price-drops/?category=laptops</a>
That website has price history of each brand and laptop names but, they don't have the comparison between the brands which are announced under "price dropped" category 


Interesting right?


The steps I did to analyse the brands and laptops name to know, which brand gives maximum dropped price : 
step 1: web scrapping of "price before.com" to get 

        i) Brands 
        ii) Laptop names 
        iii) current & previous price 
        iv) Dropped price percentage 
        
step 2: Gather all the scrapped information and created a excel file for that (You can choose your convinient way for dataset methos)

step 3: Did visualisation and analysed which product is feasible for me to buy! 


The information I took from the analysis are : 
 1) Maximum price drop percentage & product
 2) Range of price for different brands(customisable according to our budget)
 3) Current & previous price of a product
 4) List of brands & products
 5) Specifications for different products

Tada! that's it 
I'm ready with this beautiful dashboard! <a>[price drop-final.pdf](https://github.com/lathadharmalingam/Price_drop_analysis/blob/main/price%20drop-final.pdf)</a>
